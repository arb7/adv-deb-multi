# adv-deb-multi

Adversarial debiasing implementation compatible with generic pandas DataFrames and multiclass classification.

Adversarial debiasing is described in ([Zhang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07593)). This implementation modifies code by ([IBM AIF360](https://github.com/Trusted-AI/AIF360/blob/master/aif360/algorithms/inprocessing/adversarial_debiasing.py)) and is used in ([Ball-Burack et al., 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445875)).
